        <div class="main"><h2>What is Organ Donation ?</h2> 
          Organ donation is giving an organ to someone else who needs a transplant. Organ donation is an amazingly generous act and saves thousands of lives in the UK every year. However, this relies on donors and their families agreeing to donate.

        <div class="main"><h2>What is tissue donation? </h2> The majority of those who join the NHS Organ Donor Register choose to donate all their organs. However, you can also choose to donate your tissues.
Human tissue consists of cells within the body that are similar in appearance and have the same function. Donating tissue can dramatically improve the quality of life for others. As many as 50 people can be helped by the donation from one person.
Many kinds of tissue can be donated after death including skin, tendons, bone, heart valves and eyes to help repair or rebuild the lives of thousands of severely injured people. It is also possible to donate bone or amniotic membrane (part of the placenta) in certain hospitals while you are alive, during hip surgery or an elective caesarean.
Unlike organ donation, you don't need to die in a hospital intensive care unit or emergency department to donate tissue after death. Almost anyone can be considered for tissue donation, and donation needs to take place within 24 - 48 hours of death. To ensure that all donated tissues are safe, the donor's medical and lifestyle history is assessed at the time of donation.

                <div class="main"><h2>What are the restrictions?</h2>We will only use organs from a donor with their consent or with their family's consent after they die. 
If you want to make a real difference by being an organ or tissue donor after your death, there are two important steps you need to take:
<ul><li>Join the NHS Organ Donor Register</li>
<li>Tell your family and friends that you have joined the register and want to be a donor so they can support your decision</li></ul>
If you die in circumstances in which you can donate, medical staff will consult the NHS Organ Donor Register to see if you had recorded a decision about organ donation. It is also important to discuss your decision with your family so that if the time ever comes, your relatives are in no doubt that their loved one wanted to be an organ donor.

              <div class="main"><h2>Medical conditions</h2> Having an illness or medical condition doesn't necessarily prevent a person from becoming an organ or tissue donor. The decision about whether some or all organs or tissue are suitable for transplant is made by a medical specialist at the time of donation, taking into account your medical, travel and social history.
