         Deceased Donor Organ and Transplantation Program, India
         </h2>
         The Department of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India has taken up the task of promoting deceased organ donation and transplantation in the state to overcome the organ shortage problem.
         After many consultations it has decided to evolve a cadaver transplant programme on similar lines as the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
         Both these states are currently at the forefront of this programme in the country.
         <br>
         <br>
         This online secure registry is for organ recipients waiting for organ transplantation from various hospitals in the various states of India.
         These hospitals are required to be authorized to undertake transplantation of organs such as Kidneys, Liver, Heart and Lungs.
         Hospitals authorized by the Government of Rajasthan to perform deceased donor transplants are required to provide patient details via an online form in order to join the registry.
          <br>
          <br>
          Once a transplant hospital registers its details, a desktop programme to feed the waiting list of recipients is made available to the hospital with secure login.
          This would be provided by the 'Nodal Officer' of the programme through the webmaster.
          The date of registration of a recipient for kidneys will be the date of starting dialysis.
          A synchronization of the various registered hospital's registry with central registry will ensure the common waiting list priority of the patients.
